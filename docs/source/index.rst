.. TCSPC Confocal Microscopy at Purdue documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jul 22 16:23:47 2025.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. Order of Operations to add docstrings to main sphinx docs. Please follow these steps in order!
   It will make things a lot easier for us to keep track of.

   Step 1: Add descriptive and useful docstrings to the functions. They can be
   added within triple quotations like this:
   """ This is a simple template GUI measurement module for qudi.
   """
   This allows Sphinx to auto-detect documentation.

   Step 2: Create a .rst file for your document in the relevant directory. I've created
   4 separate folders, one each for GUIs, logic, interfaces, and hardware. An example .rst file
   is provided in the source directory for your reference. All you need to do is make a copy of that file
   into the right directory. 
   
   
   
   
   Please put the right
   .rst file in the right directory. PLEASE DO NOT MOVE ANY FILES WITHOUT CONFIRMATION. THIS WILL INTERFERE
   WITH THE RENDERING OF THE DOCUMENTATION.
